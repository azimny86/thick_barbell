        "name": "Reebok One GX40S Black Crosstrainer",
        "description": "The Reebok GX40s ONE Series Cross Trainer provides a total body workout without the harsh impact on your joints. The higher the resistance (choose from 32 levels), the more exertion required to push down on the slip resistant foot plates and move the handlebars. If you’re looking to focus on the lower body only, grip the fixed handlebars as an alternative targeted exercise.20 console programs on the GX40s include 12 pre-set, 3 target (time, distance covered and calories burned), manual, watts control, heart rate control, recovery and 1 user defined program - so there’s plenty of options to choose from to make your workout unique every time.During your training program you can command the workout data you need to improve results; these can be easily monitored on the 5.5” LCD display. Plus, the cross trainer’s handlebars feature hand pulse sensors enabling you to pick up your heart rate at any time during the workout.Throughout the workout you’ll find the GX40s operates with minimal noise and is sturdy in its stature with floor level adjustment. If you need to move your cross trainer to another room in the house, no problem - the GX40s features integrated wheels for easy manoeuvrability. Assembling your cross trainer is fuss-free too. It comes with an assembly manual and clear labelling to ensure you’re guided through each step.",
